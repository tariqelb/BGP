# Overview
The **BGP Project** from the 42 cursus focuses on autonomous systems, where I explore and grasp new concepts in packet forwarding and routing protocols such as **RIP, IS-IS, OSPF, and BGP**.  

The project is divided into three parts:  

### Part 1: Environment Setup  
- Install **Docker** and **GNS3**.  
- Create two Docker images to simulate a **host machine** and a **router device**.  

### Part 2: VXLAN Topology  
- Set up a **VXLAN topology** by creating a **VXLAN tunnel** between two **VTEP routers**.  

### Part 3: BGP with EVPN  
- Discover **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** and integrate it with **EVPN (Ethernet VPN)**.  

---

# Part 1: Environment Setup  
In the `p1` folder, you will find installation and uninstallation scripts for both **Docker** and **GNS3**.  
I recommend running the **GNS3 installation commands one by one** in the terminal so you can interact with the GNS3 GUI and configure it as needed.  

### Docker Images  
The project includes two **Docker images**:  
1. **Host Image**: Based on `linux/alpine` with pre-installed `busybox`.  
2. **Router Image**: Based on `linux/alpine` with `Quagga` installed and configured.  

### Importing Images into GNS3  
To use these images as **host** and **router**, follow these steps:  

1. **Build both Docker images** using their respective `Dockerfile`.  
2. Open **GNS3 GUI** and navigate to:  
   - **Edit → Preferences → Docker Containers**.  
3. Click **New** :  
   - Select the **host image** you built.  
   - Assign a name to your host.  
   - Set the number of ethernet interface
   - Set "sh" as start command
   - For the **router image** set start command "sh /launch_services.sh"
   - click finish and apply.

# Part 2

     Here you will use docker container to setup you VXLAN topology, i will share with you my topology and the process
  of configuation of each device.
